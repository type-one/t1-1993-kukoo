Some assets I could find back on my old HDD drive backup.

I've put a playable version of Laxity "The Alibi" Adlib music, in VGM, in D00 and in D01 (an enhanced one).
You can play it with some dedicated chiptune players with VGM or AdPlug extensions, like XMPlay.

I've included an MS-DOS 8x16 font that is used in the intro to redefine the default text mode font.

The last asset in the intro is an ANSI logo edited with a program called "TheDraw"
